# METACLIP provenance for the IPCC-AR6 WGI Atlas
Controlled METACLIP vocabulary for the IPCC-AR6 WGI Atlas (http://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch) based on the core [METACLIP semantic ontologies](https://github.com/metaclip/ontologies). 

This vocabulary is used to produce the provenance information for the different climatic products produced by the IPCC AR6 Interactive Atlas (see [AR6 WGI Atlas Chapter, Sec. 2.3](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/atlas/#Atlas.2.3) for full details). This information is machine-readable and it can be visualized as a semantic graph and downloaded (json-ld format) from the Atlas. It provides a comprehensive, end-to-end provenance of the different products. For a quick overview, please watch the following video abstract:
