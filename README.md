# IPCC-AR6-Atlas
Controlled METACLIP vocabulary for the IPCC-AR6 WGI Atlas (http://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch) based on the core [METACLIP semantic ontologies](https://github.com/metaclip/ontologies) for data sources (mainly CMIP5/6 and CORDEX subsets), postprocessing (temporal aggregation, regrdding, etc.), callibration (bias ajustment in this case) and graphical products. 

This vocabulary is used to produce the semmantic provenance information for the climatic products produced by the Atlas (see [AR6 WGI Atlas Chapter, Sec. 2.3](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/atlas/#Atlas.2.3) for full details). This information can be visualized and downloaed (json) from the Atlas describing the end-to-end provenance of the different products. The figure below shows an example for the number of days with maximum temperature over 35ยบ, displaying the future change for a 2ยบ Global Warming Level (right panel). The lef panel displays a semmantic graph with the different datasets involved (historical and future CMIP6 projections and observations, together with the processing chain, down to the final product -the climate change signal-).
